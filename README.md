# geoid_determination
A local geoid model was calculated using test and control points.
Local geoid model was calculated with 4-parameter Helmert Similarity Transformation model.
Data sets include geodetic coordinates which were in ITRF96 coordinate system and orthometric heights were in TUDKA99 datum.
Python script which was named 'geoid_determination' has to be in the same folder with testpoints.txt and controlpoints.txt
Figure 1 shows the distribution of control and test points with respect to their geodesic coordinates (Latitude, Longitude, Height).
Figure 2 shows height differences of test points. m0 is the error of the local geoid model.
